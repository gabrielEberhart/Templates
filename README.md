## About This Repo

Anyone can use this repository.

### For Non-Technical People: Copying a Template

Go to whichever file you want and download that specific file (or an entire
folder, if you want). Do whatever you want with it. If you don't want to keep
coming back, I recommend storing it in some sort of Templates folder (some Linux
distros come with `~/Templates/` by default and even let you [right-click your
desktop to quickly create a copy](https://askubuntu.com/questions/94734/what-is-the-templates-folder-in-the-home-directory-for)
) to quickly reference it. Or just edit the file directly and keep downloading
new copies from here. It's your computer, do what you want with it.

### Why Make This Repo?

I originally just wanted to make a collection of a couple Template files, but I
couldn't find an APA style `.odt` file within a single 7-second Google search.
So I decided to just make the Template myself. I wanted it to be available for
anyone.

### Repo Structure

The different types of templates are divided into folders. Look for whatever
folder you need, and maybe the file you need will be in there.

### Contributing

If there's a Template you want to contribute to the collection, feel free to
open a PR with the Template! I'm not too judgy so long as you're bringing in a
text file.
